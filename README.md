# KM200 Java API

This is a Java API for Bosch/Buderus/Junkers heaters with a KM200 gateway.

## TODO Maven

## Configuration

To use the API you'll need the uri, gateway password, private password and the salt.

### Private password

The private password is the one you configure yourself when you connect via the
[app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bosch.tt.buderus) to your heater.
If you forgot your password you can start the "reset internet password" flow in the menu
of your heater and then reassign a new passwort in the app.

### Gateway password

The gateway password is constant and needs to be read out from the menu of your heater (information/internet/login data).

### Salt

I didn't include the salt, because I remember slightly reading somewhere else that Bosch might step in
legally to prevent the publication. So you will have to find the salt on your on, either by searching the internet
or decompiling the [app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bosch.tt.buderus).
The format is the hexadecimal representation (e.g. "12a0b2â€¦"). Here's an incomplete list of projects in the internet
where you could find the salt:

- [ioBroker.km200](https://github.com/frankjoke/ioBroker.km200/blob/6c0963d671b50cb73f378049448a42cf22a8fecf/km200.js#L13-L17)
- [bosch-thermostat-http-client-python](https://github.com/moustic999/bosch-thermostat-http-client-python/blob/53b2469988c7b25688501669df0981f03a2cbcfa/bosch_thermostat_http/const.py#L5)
- [IPSymconBuderusKM200](https://github.com/demel42/IPSymconBuderusKM200/blob/a71ecedccf8781b607d47692e6c6ebc22a9d1aa3/BuderusKM200/module.php#L683-L686)

## Usage

With this library you can access well known endpoints of your KM200 (e.g. "/gateway/DateTime" for your heater's time).
The list of endpoints varies between installations, therefore you have to explore your KM200 yourself. Some endpoints
are writeable (e.g. "/gateway/DateTime") which you can update with this library as well.

TODO code to explore all endpoints.

### Example

    var uri = "http://192.168.0.44";
    var gatewayPassword = "1234-5678-90ab-cdef";
    var privatePassword = "secretExample";
    var timeout = Duration.ofSeconds(5);
    var salt = "1234567890aabbccddeeff11223344556677889900aabbccddeeffa0a1a2b2d3";
    
    var km200 = new KM200(uri, timeout, gatewayPassword, privatePassword, salt);
    
    // Read the heater's time
    var time = km200.queryString("/gateway/DateTime");
    System.out.println(time);
    
    // Update the heater's time
    km200.update("/gateway/DateTime", LocalDateTime.now());

### Thread safety

Code wise the API is thread safe, however your KM200 itself might not be. I did observe issues when querying my KM200 concurrently. It performed badly and with errors. It is advised to use this API not concurrently.
